        A funny story
    </h2>
        <p class="story-title">"Chipper"</p>
    <p class="story">

        At one of the work parties, when still living in Ireland, when I approached a group of colleagues,
        they were in the middle of talking about the best "Chippers". Being an introvert, I hardly ever speak in crowds,
        but decided that this is my moment, as just a couple of weeks ago we hired a stripper (chippendale) for my friends
        bachelorette party. I thought that's a bit awkward thing to talk about on a work party, but then again,
        Irish are very open and like to have a laugh, so I went along with it... <b>me</b>: "Oh, we had a chipper on my friends bachelorette
        party recently, but he wasn't really any good. He was dressed as a police man so that was cool, but...";
        And then I saw the look on everyone's face... and then my face became red... <b>me</b>: "Isn't that what 'Chippers' are?";
        <b>my boss</b>: "Actually 'Chippers' are the ones who are selling you 'Fish and Chips'".
    </p>
    <h3 class="headings moral" >
        Moral of the story:
    </h3>
    <p class="tldr  ">
        If you talk about "Chippers" with your boss, make sure you know what it means first.
